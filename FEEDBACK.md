"Good that you have put some information in the README file - well done.
The tests should have appeared in files related to the classes they test (which is the usual practice).
The javadoc from the interfaces should be referenced (@see) in the implementation code.
Now considering the eight points:
1) Good.
2) 
public boolean isEmpty(){ if (this.size() == 0){ return true; } else{ return false; }
this should be return size() == 0
3) Similar comments apply for this class
if (firstNodeInList == null){ return true; } else{ return false; }
4)  (isEmpty() == true){ just isEmpty()
5) Good.
6) Good.
7) Good.
8) Good.
A few more comments in places would have been good.
Well done."
